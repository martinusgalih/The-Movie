- **Search Movie**: Search for movies based on title.
- **Movie Detail**: View detailed information about a movie, including synopsis, cast, rating, and more.
- **Offline Mode**: Access movie data even when offline by utilizing a cache mechanism.

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Adopted this architecture to separate business logic from the view.
- **Modular Network Infrastructure**: Utilizes a modular network infrastructure for handling network requests and responses efficiently.
